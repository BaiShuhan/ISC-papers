# ISC (In Storage Computing)

<p align = "justify">
In Storage Computing (ISC) is the idea of using disk-resident processing to delegate system intelligence from host CPU to peripherals. It changes the conventional host-based computing model with dumb disks and can overcome the following bottlenecks: mismatch bandwidth, redundant data movement, high energy consumption, long I/O stack, and low utilization of SSD controller.
